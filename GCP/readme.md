# Google Cloud Platform

All the labs and demos in the class can be performed on
your personal machine (Windows or Mac).  However, if you do not have
access to a suitable machine, you may also use the widely-used
[Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com).  Among other
benefits, using GCP will 
allow you to leverage Google's powerful and scalable compute and storage
infrastructure.  These resources will be 
particularly valuable for project work beyond the simple labs in this class.

To use GCP, we provide the following instructions (some instructions 
are still being developed):
* [Creating a virtual machine](./getting_started.md) with python and jupyter notebook 
* [Using third party SSH client](./terminal.md)
* [Connecting to Google cloud storage](./cloud_storage.md)
