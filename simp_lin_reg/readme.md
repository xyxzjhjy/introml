# Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression is the most basic model in machine learning
where we fit a scalar variable `y` from another scalar variable `x` through
a linear model.  We illustrate simple linear regression with a basic demo for 
automobile data.  The lab then tests the concepts on a standard housing dataset.
