# Unit 5:  Numerical optimization

Most machine learning problems come down to performing some form of numerical
optimization to find parameters that minimize a loss function representing
how well the model fits the data.  In this section, we show how to build
a simple numerical optimizer from scratch.  We also demonstrate how to 
compute gradient in python, which are key to performing the optimization.
