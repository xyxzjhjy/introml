# Unit 8:  Convolutional and Deep Neural Networks

Convolutional and deep neural network have had trememndous success in machine
learning, particularly for image and text problems.  In this unit, we
provide a very brief introduction to these networks.  
* [Demo 8.1: 2D convolutions and convolutional layers in keras](./convolutions.ipynb)
* Demo 8.2:  Downloading images from the web.  To be added
* Demo 8.3:  Exploring VGG16.  To be added
* Lab 8:  Transfer learning with a pre-trained network
