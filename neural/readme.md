# Unit 7:  Neural Networks

In this unit, we provide an introduction to simple neural networks
with a single hidden layer.  Understanding these networks will provide the
basis for working with deep networks that will be explored in the next unit.
Before doing the demos and labs in this unit, you will need to:
*  Install a deep learning *backend*, such as [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)
*  Install [Keras](https://keras.io/#installation) which runs on top of the
deep learning backend.

You should then be able to go through the demos and labs:
* [Demo 7.1: First neural network in Keras](./synthetic.ipynb)
* [Demo 7.2: MNIST neural network classification](./mnist_neural.ipynb)
* [Lab 7:  Music instrument classification](./lab07_music_partial.ipynb)
