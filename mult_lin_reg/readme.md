# Multiple Linear Regression

In multiple linear regression, we fit a scalar variable `y` from 
a vector of predictors  `x=[x[0],...,x[k-1]]` through
a linear model of the form:
~~~python
   yhat = beta[0] + beta[1]*x[0] + ... + beta[k]*x[k-1]
~~~
Multiple linear regression is one of the most basic tools in data analysis.
We include a demo, lab and homework.
